Added Immersive portals back in, enjoy the non euclidean trip.
Actually applied patches from 0.5 that i just didn't lmfao. some are below

You now gain .06 difficulty per second, You gain .03 difficulty when you are afk.
Finally added the mob hp changes i wanted. Shouldn't be aids but the "bad" weapons are decent mid-endgame
slighty more exp from hostiles not spawned by spawner.
Most likely the last difficulty increase in a while. Seemed ok. Playtime effects mobs now hf :)

More performance mod introduced
Added inventory tweaks
Re-added curses
Ping system added
